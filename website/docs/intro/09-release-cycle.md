Each major release has a two (2) month alpha period, one (1) month beta, before a full release in April.
Each release goes into maintenance after nine (9) months, as the next release enters alpha.
This time period is choosen for alignment with AWS Lambda `nodejs` runtime releases. 
All Node.js Long-Term Support (LTS) releases that have AWS Lambda runtimes are supported.
