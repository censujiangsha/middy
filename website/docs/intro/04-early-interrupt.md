title: Early return
position: 4

Some middlewares might need to stop the whole execution flow and return a response immediately.

If you want to do this you can invoke `return response` in your middleware.

**Note**: this will totally stop the execution of successive middlewares in any phase (`before`, `after`, `onError`) and returns
an early response (or an error) directly at the Lambda level. If your middlewares do a specific task on every request
like output serialization or error handling, these won't be invoked in this case.

In this example, we can use this capability for building a sample caching middleware:

```javascript
// some function that calculates the cache id based on the current event
const calculateCacheId = event => {
  /* ... */
}
const storage = {}

// middleware
const cacheMiddleware = options => {
  let cacheKey

  const cacheMiddlewareBefore = async (request) => {
    cacheKey = options.calculateCacheId(request.event)
    if (options.storage.hasOwnProperty(cacheKey)) {
      // exits early and returns the value from the cache if it's already there
      return options.storage[cacheKey]
    }
  }

  const cacheMiddlewareAfter = async (request) => {
    // stores the calculated response in the cache
    options.storage[cacheKey] = request.response
  }

  return {
    before: cacheMiddlewareBefore,
    after: cacheMiddlewareAfter
  }
}

// sample usage
const handler = middy((event, context) => {
  /* ... */
}).use(
  cacheMiddleware({
    calculateCacheId,
    storage
  })
)
```
