Middy has been one of the first projects to encourage the adoption of middlewares to simplify code reuse and best practices within the context of Lambda.

Since middy started to gain popularity in the Node.js ecosystem, we have seen some independent projects taking the same ideas to other ecosystems:

- .Net port [Voxel.MiddyNet](https://github.com/VoxelGroup/Voxel.MiddyNet) [@vgaltes](https://twitter.com/vgaltes/status/1366371605337825284)
- GoLang port [Vesper](https://github.com/mefellows/vesper)

Do you have a similar project? Let us know.
